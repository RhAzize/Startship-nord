# Custom (Warp) Nord Theme for Starship

This repository contains a custom theme based on the **Nord** color palette for the [Starship prompt](https://starship.rs/). Starship is a cross-shell prompt that is fast, customizable, and intuitive.

This theme was inspired by the **Gruvbox Rainbow** theme for Starship, but has been customized to fit my personal preferences using the cool tones of the Nord color palette.
